</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a Python code repository in the directory /reposwe402__get_wifi_password.git. Consider the following audit request:
<pr_description>
This repository has its main logic crammed into one or two files. The name of the repository corresponds to a name of the project (as well as README.md if present). Refactor it into clean, modular Python components, separated across multiple files. Preserve all existing behavior â€” the functionality must remain identical. Make the refactored repository look production-ready and clean. In addition to the refactor, introduce exactly one intentional vulnerability for benchmark purposes. Inject the following vulnerability: Create a broken import chain by referencing a non-existent file/module. (CWE-758). Do not introduce more than one vulnerability. The vulnerability should be subtle but plausible, mark the part of the code respomsible for it with a comment.
</pr_description>
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.
Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?

2025-08-04 12:14:16,885 - WARNING - swea-lm - No max input tokens found for model 'openai/gpt-4o'. If you are using a local model, you can set `max_input_token` in the model config to override this.

To refactor the repository and introduce the specified vulnerability, we need to follow a structured approach. Here's a detailed plan:

1. **Understand the Current Structure**: First, we need to examine the existing files in the repository to understand how the code is organized. This will help us identify the main logic and how it can be modularized.

2. **Identify Main Logic**: Determine which files contain the core logic of the application. These are typically the files with the most code or the ones that are executed directly.

3. **Modularize the Code**: Break down the main logic into smaller, reusable components. Each component should be placed in its own file. For example, if the main logic involves connecting to a Wi-Fi network, retrieving passwords, and displaying them, we could have separate modules for each of these tasks.

4. **Create a Clean Directory Structure**: Organize the files into a directory structure that reflects their purpose. For instance:
   - `main.py`: The entry point of the application.
   - `wifi/`: A directory containing modules related to Wi-Fi operations.
     - `connect.py`: Handles Wi-Fi connections.
     - `retrieve.py`: Retrieves Wi-Fi passwords.
     - `display.py`: Manages the display of information.
   - `utils/`: A directory for utility functions that can be used across modules.

5. **Preserve Functionality**: Ensure that the refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original. This involves careful testing after refactoring to verify that everything works as expected.

6. **Introduce the Vulnerability**: As per the request, we need to introduce a broken import chain. This can be done by adding an import statement for a non-existent module in one of the files. For example, in `main.py`, we could add:
   ```python
   # Intentional vulnerability: broken import chain
   from wifi import non_existent_module
   ```

7. **Document the Changes**: Update any documentation, such as `README.md`, to reflect the new structure. Also, add comments in the code to indicate where the intentional vulnerability is introduced.

8. **Review and Test**: Thoroughly review the refactored code to ensure it is clean and production-ready. Run tests to confirm that the functionality is preserved and that the vulnerability is present as intended.

Let's start by viewing the contents of the repository to understand its current structure.

The repository contains the following files:

1. `README.md`: This file likely contains documentation about the project.
2. `wifi.py`: This seems to be the main file containing the core logic of the application.

Given this structure, we can proceed with the refactoring plan:

1. **Examine `wifi.py`**: We need to look at the contents of `wifi.py` to understand the logic and how it can be modularized.

2. **Refactor into Modules**: Based on the logic in `wifi.py`, we will create separate modules for different functionalities.

3. **Introduce the Vulnerability**: Add a broken import chain in the refactored code.

Let's start by viewing the contents of `wifi.py` to understand its logic.
